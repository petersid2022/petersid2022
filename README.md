# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Peter Sideris, an Electrical Engineering student from Greece. Welcome to my Github profile!
## About Me
I have a strong passion for software development and enjoy working with new and cutting-edge technologies. I'm particularly interested in exploring the fields of hardware and software engineering, with a focus on embedded systems and low-level programming.

**I also have a blog, I write there sometimes - whatever I happen to find cool.**
